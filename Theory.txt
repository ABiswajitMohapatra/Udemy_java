1.Read only(getter method)
2.Write only.(setter method)

Constructor:

initialize the properties at the time of construction;or object creation;
constructor is called automatically whwnever we are creating an object:
Every class has default constructor  if no explicit constructor provided by programmer, compiler provides one for us.
-new keyword creates a new instance of that class and calls constructor to initialize it with some default values.
-using new keyword, constructor will be invoked by default.
-without using new keyword, it won't be invoked.
constructor have same name as class.
it dont have returnn type.
we can use (this) keyword to refer to current.
it's of two types 
1.parameterised
2.non parameterised

As like method overloading we have construction overloading  also in java but with some restrictions :
